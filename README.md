# Unit 6 README: Bash Scripting and Programming

# Unit Description

In the final unit of our introduction to Linux system administration, I learned how to combine commands, create custom commands, and write bash scripts.

I used these skills to collect logs, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system.

In Day 3, I went on to participate in a Linux Scavenger Hunt. This extended activity allowed me to use all the skills and tools covered in the past three units.
